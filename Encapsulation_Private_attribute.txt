In this example I wanted to test the Access modifiers and that python did not naturally support getters and setters. I wrote a very short code to Show how simple getters and setters work. I first had problems with @property because in C++ there are no such things. Then I decided to write a traditional getter and setter so if I anyone who is using a different language can understand and copy the code for their studies.
