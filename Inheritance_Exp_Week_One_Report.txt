With this example I learned how inheritance worked and wrote my first ever instance of class all by myself. I used multiple definitions so that I could be sure the code works as intended. It worked as planned and I did not use one class and one object, they are just there but after seeing it works on the object Brute_1 I knew it would work with Ninja_1 too. This first day was a success. I will code/share examples about the following; Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.
